## Python Implementation of Airport Database Using SQL

This simple UI simulates the booking process for flights through “Falcone Airlines”. When immediately running the project, it will request your SSN as a passenger. If the SSN exists in the table “Passenger”, then it will send you straight to the menu. If not, it will ask for your information and add it to the “Passenger” table.

In the menu, you get 4 options: Book, View Reservation, Cancel Reservation, or Quit. There are numbered options and to choose them, you can either enter the number or the name of the option. When choosing each option, you are given appropriate information and directed clearly on what you need to do.
