# Python Implementation of Airport Database Using SQL

This simple UI simulates the booking process for flights through “Falcone Airlines”. When immediately running the project, it will request your SSN as a passenger. If the SSN exists in the table “Passenger”, then it will send you straight to the menu. If not, it will ask for your information and add it to the “Passenger” table.

In the menu, you get 4 options: Book, View Reservation, Cancel Reservation, or Quit. There are numbered options and to choose them, you can either enter the number or the name of the option. When choosing each option, you are given appropriate information and directed clearly on what you need to do.

## Project Requirements:

Objective: To create an application in programming languages such as Python/Java that interacts with a MySQL database.

Description: Create an Airline Booking System to book a flight for Falcone Airlines. The booking system stores the details such as the airport, flight schedule, passengers, and their booking. You will use Python/Java and MySQL to create and manage this database.

Goals: 
1. Write a Python/Java program to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on the MySQL database.
2. Allow the passengers to book a flight and view and delete their bookings.

Conclusion: This project provides hands-on experiences with database programming. The database API allows interaction between systems and applications.
